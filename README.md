# ECSE211DPM Robot Competition
We designed and built a robot using LEGO EV3 mindstorms kit to navigate through a zipline, detect the colored object, and navigate back to the origin point. 

This implementation consists of a thread to keep track of the robot's current position, a thread to detect object in the front using an Ultrasonic sensor, and a thread to detect the color of the object using a light sensor. The task includes determining the initial position and orientation on the grid, navigating to the zipline, finding the colored object, and returning back to the initial position.
